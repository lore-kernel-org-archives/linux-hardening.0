As we saw when distros tried to mitigate copy.fail, a lot of distros
have CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_* set to 'y', so algif_aead.ko couldn't be
blacklisted.  (Ironically because of FIPS 140, which is yet another
example of how FIPS 140 harms real-world security.)

But even when 'm', the module blacklist is just a binary choice for each
algorithm type: aead, skcipher, hash, and rng.  Loading algif_aead.ko
allows not just "ccm(aes)" that bluez needs, but also bizarre things
like "authencesn(hmac(sha256),cbc(aes))" that are used only in exploits.

And sure, userspace could theoretically gather the complete list of
algorithm modules (e.g. authencesn.ko) and blacklist them individually.
But no one does that, and many are built-in anyway -- and this time not
just because of FIPS.

So we need an allowlist at the algorithm level, not just the algorithm
type level.  Putting the allowlist in the kernel, taking into account
the real use cases like iwd and bluez, and having a simple tristate
sysctl similar to some of the existing ones, is the simplest and most
practical way to achieve this by default across Linux distros.

If we did something like delegate the algorithm allowlist to LSMs, I
think that in practice it's just going to be almost never used.

I had thought about that to but I felt a bit iffy about it. You could
envision an FOP_* flag for this:

  /* Module may use splice-like apis */
  #define FOP_MAY_SPLICE          ((__force fop_flags_t)(1 << 8))

But that doesn't address how fundamentally broken vmsplice() for example
really is and that probably no one should get to use it in its current
form.

And that's the usual problem where rando module will just raise the
flag. Maybe that's fine and we will keep up.

I see this is the "let's become goat-farmers" portion of the message.

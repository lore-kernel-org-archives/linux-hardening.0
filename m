If you have the size comparisons handy, I'd love to see them. My memory
from v5 was that none of that end up in-core. And in that case, why
limit the entropy of the resulting layout?

Agreed: I'd rather have LD_ORPHAN_WARN always enabled.

But not at this cost. Maybe the x86 maintainers will disagree, but I see
this as a prohibitive cost to doing development work under FGKASLR, and
if we expect this to become the default in distros, no one is going to
be happy with that change. Link time dominates the partial rebuild time,
so my opinion is that it should not be so inflated if not absolutely
needed. Perhaps once the link time bugs in ld.bfd and ld.lld get fixed,
but not now.

There's a difference between development time costs and run time costs.
I don't think the LD_ORPHAN_WARN coverage is worth it in this case.

Either way, we need to fix the linker.

I get what you mean with regard to getting the perfect situation, but
the kernel went 29 years without LD_ORPHAN_WARN. :) Anyway, we'll see
what other folks think, I guess.

Well, because it was blocked then by a single bug, and everything else
you've described are distinct improvements on v5, so to me it makes
sense to have it separated into those phases. I don't mean split the
series, I mean rearrange the series so that a rebased v5 is at the
start, and the improvements follow.

Understood. I am suggesting some ideas about how it might help with
review. :)

Ah-ha, thanks. I must have missed your answer to this earlier. I had
probably done my initial v5 testing without modules.

Yes, but we've had a history of making big patches that do _intend_ to
break the i386 build, but they do anyway. Hence my question.

Understood. I just find it confusing to include patches on lkml that
already exist in a -next branch. Perhaps base on kbuild -next?

*shrug* They're trivial changes that have been reviewed before, so it
seems like we can avoid resending them every time.

Mostly it's a question of building on prior testing (v5 worked), so that
new changes can be debugged if they cause problems. Regardless, it's
been so long, perhaps it won't matter to other reviewers and they'll
want to just start over from scratch.

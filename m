I think that splice and vmsplice() are pretty wonky apis. Ignoring it's
recent prominent role in page cache attacks it suffers from weird issues
due to its interactions with pipe_lock().

Bug with splice to a pipe preventing a process exit
20250122020850.2175427-1-kolyshkin@gmail.com
Sendfile holding pipe->mutex blocks the peer's pipe_release() from do_exit().

[PATCH v2 00/11] Avoid unprivileged splice(file->)/(->socket) pipe exclusion
cover.1703126594.git.nabijaczleweli@nabijaczleweli.xyz
Pending splice from tty/socket/FIFO holds pipe->mutex indefinitely, blocking all other FIFO ops incl. read(O_NONBLOCK)

splice: prevent deadlock when splicing a file to itself

do_splice_direct_actor() still lacks file_inode(in) == file_inode(out) guard

AF_UNIX/zerocopy/pipe/vmsplice/splice vs FOLL_PIN
2135907.1747061490@warthog.procyon.org.uk
vmsplice/splice into AF_UNIX/pipe doesn't FOLL_PIN the source memory

My main gripe with the patch as written is that I find it really hard to
figure out who would deploy this. It half-cripples splice() and
vmsplice() for some use-cases but leaves it intact for others.

At that point you can also just ENOSYS splice() and vmsplice() via
seccomp and force a fallback on non-splice codepaths that userspace has
to have anyway as splice() isn't supported unconditionally.

It feels like a knee-jerk reaction to an exploit class originating in
buggy modules that we have little control over and we would extend an
API to users that is really difficult to use.

What might make more sense is to add a splice specific security_*() hook
into the code so that an LSM can deny usage of splice in whatever way it
wants to - bpf lsm or in-tree lsm.

Then we don't have to have all this gunk in the VFS layer that will be
annoying to maintain with little value in the long-term. So I'm not very
likely to pick this up as is.

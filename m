Hi!

So, it seems like the seccomp selftests broke in a few places due to
this change (back in v5.15). I really thought kernelci.org was running
the seccomp tests, but it seems like the coverage is spotty.

Specifically, the syscall_restart selftest fails, as well as syscall_errno
and syscall_faked (both via seccomp and PTRACE), starting with this patch.

While I've reproducing the bisect done by mediatek, I'm still poking
around in here to figure out what's gone wrong. There was a recent patch
to fix this, but it looks like it's not complete:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230724121655.7894-1-lecopzer.chen@mediatek.com/

With the above applied, syscall_errno and syscall_faked start working
again, but not the syscall_restart test.

Another issue of note, which may just be "by design" for arm32, is that
an invalid syscall (or, at least, a negative syscall) results in SIGILL,
rather than a errno=ENOSYS failure. This seems to have been true at least
as far back as v5.8 (where this was cleaned up for at least arm64 and
s390). There was a seccomp test added for it in v5.9, but it has been
failing for arm32 since then. :(

I mention this because the behavior of the syscall_restart test looks
like an invalid syscall: on restart a SIGILL is caught instead of the
syscall correctly continuing.

Anyway, I'll keep debugging this, but figured I'd mention it in case
anyone else had been seeing issues in here.

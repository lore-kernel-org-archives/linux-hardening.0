Hi all,

As I haven=E2=80=99t found any news on the list or the tree, I'd like to =
inquire whether
there=E2=80=99s been any updates on the situation.

Sorry if I misunderstood something, but isn=E2=80=99t that basically the =
only effective
way to use DOITM? DDP is not active in kernel mode regardless of DOITM =
and the
FSFP documentation says that existing mitigations for SSB and such =
=E2=80=9Cusually=E2=80=9D
will also be sufficient for FSFP. I assume in absence of KERNEL_SSBD, =
the other
existing mitigations would simply be augmented as necessary, rather than
enabling something alike KERNEL_FSFPD. But I may be totally mistaken =
here.
I further assume variable-latency instruction semantics still do not =
apply, so
to my understanding, FSFP is the only potential concern to the kernel, =
and it=E2=80=99s
not that bad.

Meanwhile, DDP is active in userspace and potentially violates the =E2=80=9C=
no
secret-dependent memory accesses=E2=80=9D constant-time programming rule =
at the
microarchitectural level. While real-world risk is up for debate, for =
truly
constant-time execution it must never trigger on memory that contains =
secrets.
To my knowledge, the only way to achieve this right now is to turn it =
off. The
Intel documentation also recommends against turning it off generally. =
So, either
there must be an opt-out per-process (and the processes should be mostly
isolated regarding computation on secrets, otherwise all other =
operations face
the performance penalty as well), or there must be a dynamic toggle like =
there
is for prctl() speculation control. As ARM has basically the same thing, =
I=E2=80=99m not
sure there=E2=80=99s much benefit in relaxing the semantics (but there =
might be in
making it accessible in userspace).

OT/Motivation: DDP has a rarely talked about implication from the =
prefetching
window. Namely, when accessing non-secret memory adjacent to secret =
memory, it
can activate on secret memory even when it is never accessed while DDP =
is
enabled. There are multiple solutions to this, e.g., to place guard =
pages around
secret memory and trust DDPs will fault and back off. Another way is to =
make
sure secret memory is never mapped while DDPs are active. I=E2=80=99m =
playing around
with this at the moment because unmapping secret memory also would mean =
that
mitigations like SLH only need to be applied to code that can execute =
while
secret memory is mapped. This can be achieved with pkeys, but it =
requires some
extra work to ensure no process=E2=80=99s secret memory pkey allows =
reads while DDPs are
on, even during context switches. Maybe more on that to come, maybe not, =
but I
wanted to provide my motivation in this. :)

The Intel documentation seems to be fairly stable, so I assume not much =
happened
on the hardware/ISA side?

Thank you!

I also have in mind the kernel user case. How would a kernel programmer
want to add some kernel structs/info/buffers into kmemdump such that the
dump would contain their data ? Having "KMEMDUMP_VAR(...)" looks simple
enough.
Otherwise maybe the programmer has to write helpers to compute lengths
etc, and stitch them into kmemdump core.
I am not saying it's impossible, but just tiresome perhaps.

This could work, but it requires again adding some code into the
specific subsystem. E.g. struct_rq_get_size()
I am open to ideas , and thank you very much for your thoughts.

I would not really need to dump the runqueues. But the crash tool which
I am using for testing, requires it. Without the runqueues it will not
progress further to load the kernel dump.
So I am not really sure what it does with the runqueues, but it works.
Perhaps using crash/gdb more, to actually do something with this data,
would give more insight about its utility.
For me, it is a prerequisite to run crash, and then to be able to
extract the log buffer from the dump.

I understand. The section idea was suggested by Thomas. Initially I was
skeptic, but I like how it turned out.

My initial thought was the same. However I got some feedback from Petr
Mladek here :

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/aBm5QH2p6p9Wxe_M@localhost.localdomain/

Where he explained how to register the structs correctly.
It can be that setup_log_buf is called again at a later time perhaps.

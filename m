I was looking strictly at the layer it was happening: the function that
calls memcpy() is working on a bkey_i, so I figured that was the place
for it currently.

The future work here is about making sure flexible arrays don't overlap
with non-flexible array members[1], and that will require giving some
thought to how the structures are arranged.

The specific "problem" being solved is the ambiguity in the C language
for dealing with flexible arrays. For example, this will already throw a
warning:

struct whoops {
	u32 stuff;
	u8 how_many_shorts;
	u16 shorts[];
	u64 flags;
};

Doing struct_size()-style allocations will end up with a clobbered
"flags" member when accessing the first 4 "shorts", etc. This neighboring
overwrite corruption code pattern has happened (and been fixed) a bunch[2]
in the kernel when someone adds a new member to a struct at the end
without noticing the flexible array. (In the past, it was usually via
the 0-sized arrays, e.g. "u16 shorts[0]".) One of the many benefits of
using C99 flex arrays is that the compiler will warn now (when it's in
the same struct), and "flags" can be moved to the right place, etc.

*However*, the compiler wasn't warning about composite structures, like
this:

struct inner {
	u32 stuff;
	u8 how_many_shorts;
	u16 shorts[];
};

struct whoops {
	struct inner instance;
	u64 flags;
};

This ends up being an ambiguous situation: is "flags" an interpretation
of the first 4 "shorts", or is it an accidental overlap that will lead
to memory corruption? So, in our ongoing battle to eliminate ambiguities
in the codebase, we've moving away from this code pattern (with the
help of the future -Wflex-array-member-not-at-end compiler option),
by switching to unambiguous structure layouts.

The common "intentional overlap" use-case is very similar to the bcachefs
code. For example:

struct header {
	u32 long flags;
	struct other things;
	size_t byte_count;
	u8 bytes[];
};

struct cmd_one {
	struct header hdr;
	u64 detail;
	u8 bits;
};

struct cmd_two {
	struct header hdr;
	u32 foo, bar;
	u64 baz;
};

The use of "struct header" effectively says "we have some number of bytes,
but we don't know *what* it is yet". Is it cmd_one, or cmd_two? Instead
of combining the flex array with the header, we can either split it off:

struct header {
	u32 long flags;
	struct other things;
	size_t byte_count;
};

struct cmd_unknown {
	struct header;
	u8 bytes[];
};

Or we can merge all the structs together:

struct everything {
	u32 long flags;
	struct other things;
	size_t byte_count;
	union {
		struct cmd_one {
			u64 detail;
			u8 bits;
		};
		struct cmd_two {
			u32 foo, bar;
			u64 baz;
		};
		struct unknown {
			u8 bytes[];
		};
	};
};

In the first style, the flexible array is distinctly separate. In the
second style the overlap is explicitly shown via the union.

I expect it will take a long time to make the kernel "flex array overlap
clean", so while I don't feel any rush, I've been generally trying to
avoid seeing new instances of ambiguous overlap _added_ to the kernel. :)

bcachefs is in a unique places where because it's been out of tree
its code patterns aren't "new", but it's just been "added" upstream.
*shrug* So we'll deal with the existing warnings we've already got,
and prepare for the future warnings as we can.

Hopefully that helps!

Hello David,

I am looking again into this, and there are some things which in my
opinion would be difficult to achieve.
For example I looked into my patch #11 , which adds the `runqueues` into
kmemdump.

The runqueues is a variable of `struct rq` which is defined in
kernel/sched/sched.h , which is not supposed to be included outside of
sched.
Now moving all the struct definition outside of sched.h into another
public header would be rather painful and I don't think it's a really
good option (The struct would be needed to compute the sizeof inside
vmcoreinfo). Secondly, it would also imply moving all the nested struct
definitions outside as well. I doubt this is something that we want for
the sched subsys. How the subsys is designed, out of my understanding,
is to keep these internal structs opaque outside of it.

From my perspective it's much simpler and cleaner to just add the
kmemdump annotation macro inside the sched/core.c as it's done in my
patch. This macro translates to a noop if kmemdump is not selected.

How do you see this done another way ?

The dumping mechanism needs to work for dynamically allocated stuff, and
right now, it works for e.g. printk, if the buffer is dynamically
allocated later on in the boot process.

To have this working outside of printk, it would be required to walk
through all the printk structs/allocations and select the required info.
Is this something that we want to do outside of printk ? E.g. for the
printk panic-dump case, the whole dumping is done by registering a
dumper that does the job inside printk. There is no mechanism walking
through printk data in another subsystem (in my example, pstore).
So for me it is logical to register the data inside the printk.

Does this make sense ?

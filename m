Heh, yeah, I've been trying to aim people at using seq_buf instead of
a long series of snprintf/strlcat/etc calls. Where can I look at how
you wired this up to seq_buf/printbuf? I had trouble finding it when I
looked before. I'd really like to find a way to do it without leaving
around foot-guns for future callers of string_get_size(). :)

I found the printbuf series:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220808024128.3219082-1-willy@infradead.org/
It seems there are some nice improvements in there. It'd be really nice
if seq_buf could just grow those changes. Adding a static version of
seq_buf_init to be used like you have PRINTBUF_EXTERN would be nice
(or even a statically sized initializer). And much of the conversions
is just changing types and functions. If we can leave all that alone,
things become MUCH easier to review, etc, etc. I'd *love* to see an
incremental improvement for seq_buf, especially the heap-allocation
part.

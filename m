I won't say you don't have a point. However, the whole idea is to attempt to
restrict the attack vector. This is a proven source of problems. It's known
since 2022 - now we have 3 or 4 new vulnerabilities taking advantage of this.

Clearly, the kernel isn't doing great passing these pages around the kernel.
The API isn't the easiest to use (much less safely). Can those be tackled? Yes.
Today? Definitely not. In a few years? Also doubtful.

Merging something like this (or equivalent, that allows for a restriction) I
think is simply common sense. Basic hardening of interfaces so if anything
gets discovered it's much less severe. Even if nothing else related to splice()
gets discovered, I think it's still useful to have secure by default, minimally
intrusive hardening in the kernel.

One example: do you really need to be able to send SUID binaries in a zero-copy
super efficient way around the kernel? Not really. But if something fscks it up,
you get the world's easiest LPE.

(not that today they couldn't find some random UAF and attempt to exploit this,
since all of the page cache is mapped, but there are concurrent efforts e.g ASI
that attempt to tackle this)

Sadly, for the networking case it's pretty important to have autoloading
for protocol modules. Also, for the module in question (for Fragnesia it was
ESP), that's really not that arcane. It's just a piece of code that gets
confused as to whether or not it owns (versus "shares", like it should) the
pages it's looking at.

With fragnesia it's been found out that there are _several_ important spots
in the networking stack that aren't getting this shared flag propagation
correctly.

It's beyond my skillset to comment whether or not that works well in
practice :)

I would assume it's hard to race the bad guys (the typical security problem).
You get a great zero-day as a blackhat and (AIUI) you might be looking at
tens-to-even-hundreds of thousands in rewards.

But, again, not really my field of expertise :v

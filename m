I think blocking isn't going to be useful as it will make it harder for
distros to turn this on. So we should degrade.

You don't have to convince me that it's a problematic api.

Let's discuss the other aggressive alternative: Can we try and
unconditionally degrade to copy. This would affect sendfile(), splice(),
and vmsplice(). Worst-case we would have to introduce the sysctl
retroactively.

Thoughts?

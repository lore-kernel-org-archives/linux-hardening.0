Maybe ENODATA as return code, in order to make it obvious to the
caller that the siginfo is missing? In the end if somebody requests
it, they probably should have already checked that the child process
was killed by a signal, by using WNOWAIT with waitid() or wait4().

Additionally, there might be a problem with input params. The waitid()
can take P_ALL or P_PGID as arguments. If waitid() returns with 0, the
pid of the child process generating the event can be read from
si->si_pid. But siginfo_t is a union of multiple different structs,
many of them missing si_pid. So, such a flag (__WCHILDSIGINFO) would
make sense with P_PID and P_PIDFD only, maybe this should be
explicitly checked for?

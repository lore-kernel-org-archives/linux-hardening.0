Well, I raised that with Steve way back when I was starting on the
conversions of existing code, and I couldn't get any communication out
him regarding making those changes to seq_buf.

So, I'd _love_ to resurrect that patch series and get it in after the
bcachefs merger, but don't expect me to go back and redo everything :)
the amount of code in existing seq_buf users is fairly small compared to
bcachef's printbuf usage, and what that patch series does in the rest of
the kernel anyways.

I'd rather save that energy for ditching the seq_file interface and
making that just use a printbuf - clean up that bit of API
fragmentation.

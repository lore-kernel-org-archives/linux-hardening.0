Not just splice() and vmsplice(), but sendfile(), copy_file_range() too.
My bet (perhaps not informed enough) is that there simply aren't that many
users doing splice-like opeartions from files they do not own in some way.

(maybe not true for copy_file_range(), I admit)

IIRC GNU grep is one simple example where they assume splice() from a pipe
to /dev/null Just Works(tm) and it exits(1) otherwise.

I don't dislike that option, but I don't love leaving hardening to LSMs. The
kernel quite literally gets a new splice-related vulnerability every week now,
where userspace gets to pass pages it has no business passing to funky
codepaths that then write on these pages. I feel like natively restricting
what you can pass is simply a natural way forward.

Totally. That's what the RFC tag is for :)
